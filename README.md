# infinitesimalModel

with Olivier Martin, GQE - Le Moulon (INRAE)

simulation, analysis and plot scripts for the infinitesimal project (Tourrette and Martin, 2024, arxiv preprint  	
https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2401.04095).







Note that the script plot.r is not really useful as the code for the plots is actually in analysis.r
The simulation script is recurrence_variance.r
